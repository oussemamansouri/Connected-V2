# Connected V2
I'm thrilled to present the culmination of my hard work and dedication â€“ the presentation of my latest project, "Connected"!

Connected is more than just a platform; it's a bridge connecting training centers with eager learners across Tunisia. Utilizing Angular, Spring Boot, and a SQL database, I developed the first version of this intuitive platform, facilitating seamless interactions between learners and educational institutions.

But that's not all! In my pursuit of mastering various backend technologies and enhancing my educational journey, I created an alternative version of the platform using Express.js, Node.js, and Sequelize ORM. This endeavor not only enriches my skill set but also underscores my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

- Angular CLI: 14.1.3
- Node: 16.16.0
